                        I grew up playing video games and I have always been competitive playing against other people. 
                        For me, gaming is a great outlet to keep your mental and physical reflexes up to speed. It is also how I de-stress 
                        after a long week or if I need to get some "me" time to recharge as an introvert.

                        I started mining Cryptocurrency in early 2020, just before Bitcoin's price shot up to record levels.
                        Cryptocurrency is very interesting to me and I do believe it is the way of the future. It is very exciting
                        how volatile it is and in my opinion is a good alternative way to invest in addition to other methods.

                        Growing up both of my brothers were on our High School Marksmanship team and did well. So when I started High School the Marksmanship
                        coach wanted me to be on the team. I ended up loving it and ended up setting several city records.
                        After about 7 years in the National Guard, I found out that there was a State Marksmanship competition, so the first
                        year I competed I ended up winning 2nd place overall. The state ended up asking me to be on their Marksmanship team and
                        I have since won several trophies and competed both Nationally and Internationally.

                        I have been working as an IVR Developer since December 2016. IVR stands for interactive voice response, which is the automated phone lines that

                        Javascript. I have been involved with re-writing two different IVR's as a whole.

                        I joined the Army National Guard in May 2007. I originally joined as a FireFighter. Due to lack of career progression potential, I re-classed
                        to an IT Specialist, which is much more fitting for my civilian career. I am currently a Sergeant First Class and am in charge of ensuring
                        that the training site that I drill at is ran safely and any units that are training that weekend have everything they need.
